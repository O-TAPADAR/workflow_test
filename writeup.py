If I were tasked with building a system to automatically check for accessibility in an asset, I would check the following (to start off with): 
- Alt text for images
- Colour Contrast 
- Form Accessibility 

1. Alt text for images

Alt text is a brief description of an image. This is useful for users who are visually impaired. 
We can check if images have the 'alt' attribute in the HTML. If there's none, we can use an image captioning model (i.e. BLIP model) to 
automatically generate descriptions for images. 

Pseudocode: 

from transformers import BlipModel

for image in html_content.images:
    if image.alt is None:
        generated_alt = BlipModel.generate(image.src)
        return f"Missing alt text for {image.src}. Suggested alt text: {generated_alt}"

2. Color Contrast

In web design, maintaining sufficient contrast between text and background is essential for readability. 
The WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) recommends a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for standard text. 
We should parse the HTML, find all elements that contain text and check their styles for both the text- and background color.
We then calculate the contrast ratio and advice the user on (potentially) changing the colors. 

def extract_styles_from_element(element):
    fg_color = element.value_of_css_property("color") 
    bg_color = element.value_of_css_property("background-color") 
    
    return fg_color, bg_color

for element in html_content.text_elements: 
    fg_color, bg_color = extract_styles_from_element(text)
    contrast_ratio = calculate_contrast_ratio(fg_color, bg_color)

    # Check against WCAG thresholds
    if contrast_ratio < 4.5: 
        print(f"Low contrast detected in element: {element.tag_name}. Contrast Ratio: {contrast_ratio}")
    else:
        print(f"Contrast is acceptable for element: {element.tag_name}. Contrast Ratio: {contrast_ratio}")

3. Keyboard Navigatibility 

Some users use the keyboard to navigate (e.g. users with motor disabilities). 
Therefore, it's important to ensure that focus indicators are visible on all interactive elements, such as buttons, links and form fields.
We can do this by parsing the CSS to verify that a visible focus indicator is applied (outline property, for example). 

def check_focus_indicators(css_content):
    interactive_elements = css_content.get_interactive_elements()
    for element in interactive_elements:
        if element.has_focus_indicator() is None: 
            return f"Element {element.id} does not have a visible focus indicator."
    return "All interactive elements have visible focus indicators."
